1. Ensure that the most current version of NPM is installed:
    
    sudo npm install -g npm@latest
    
Working with Node.js is easier when NPM is installed. Here are some useful commands to interact with installed packages:

- `npm ls`: List the installed packages to determine if you need to install a package before you run it.
    
- `npm run-script`: Starts the specified script.
    
- `npm start`: Starts the specified package.
    
- `npm stop`: Stops the specified package.
    
- `npm restart`: Restarts the specified package.

    sudo ps -ef | grep node

     sudo apt remove -y nodejs
     sudo apt remove -y npm

```
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/npm 
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/share/man/man1/node*

It looks like you're running the `npm install` command. This command is used to install the dependencies specified in your project's `package.json` file. Here's a breakdown of what happens when you run `npm install`:

1. **Dependency Installation:**
    
    - The `npm install` command reads the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` sections of your `package.json` file.
    - It downloads and installs the specified packages and their respective versions.
2. **Node Modules Directory:**
    
    - The installed packages are stored in the `node_modules` directory in your project.
3. **Lock File:**
    
    - If your project has a `package-lock.json` file, it ensures that the exact versions of the dependencies are installed. This helps in achieving consistency across different installations.
4. **Scripts Execution:**
    
    - If there is a `"postinstall"` script defined in your `package.json`, it will be executed after the installation of dependencies.
5. **Global vs. Local:**
    
    - If you use the `-g` or `--global` flag, it installs the package globally, making it available system-wide. Without the flag, it installs the package locally in your project.

To run `npm install`:

bashCopy code

`$ npm install`

Make sure you are in the root directory of your project when running this command. After running it, your project should have all the necessary dependencies installed, and you can proceed with running your tests or any other scripts defined in your `package.json`.


It seems like you have a set of npm scripts related to the development, watch mode, and production modes of your project. Let me explain each one:

1. **Development Mode:**
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `$ npm run start`
    
    This command is likely configured to start your application in development mode. In development mode, your application might be set up to provide additional debugging information, automatic reloading of changes, and other features that are helpful during the development process.
    
2. **Watch Mode:**
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `$ npm run start:dev`
    
    This command is likely configured to start your application in watch mode. Watch mode monitors your project files for changes, and when changes are detected, it automatically triggers a recompilation or restart of your application. This is useful during development as it speeds up the feedback loop.
    
3. **Production Mode:**
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `$ npm run start:prod`
    
    This command is configured to start your application in production mode. In production mode, your application is optimized for performance, and debugging information may be minimized. This mode is typically used when deploying your application to a live environment.
    

The actual configuration and behavior of these commands depend on your project and the tools/frameworks you are using (e.g., Node.js, Express, NestJS, etc.). You can find more details about these scripts in your project's `package.json` file, especially in the "scripts" section.

Before running these commands, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. If you haven't run `npm install` yet, you should do so to ensure that all required packages are installed. After that, you can use these commands to start and manage your application in different modes.


It seems like you have npm scripts set up for running unit tests, end-to-end (e2e) tests, and generating test coverage reports in your project. Here's a breakdown of each command:

1. **Unit Tests:**
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `$ npm run test`
    
    This command is likely configured to run your unit tests. Unit tests are designed to test individual components or functions in isolation to ensure they work as expected. The actual testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha, Jasmine) and its configuration will determine how these tests are executed.
    
2. **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `$ npm run test:e2e`
    
    This command is likely configured to run your end-to-end tests. E2E tests simulate real user scenarios and interactions with your application, checking how different components work together. The testing framework for E2E tests might be tools like Cypress, Puppeteer, or others.
    
3. **Test Coverage:**
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `$ npm run test:cov`
    
    This command is configured to generate test coverage reports. Test coverage measures the percentage of your codebase that is covered by tests. The configuration for test coverage depends on the testing framework and coverage tool you are using (e.g., Istanbul).
    

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed by running `npm install` before executing these commands. Additionally, check your project's `package.json` file for the specific configurations of these scripts and the testing tools being used. If you are using a specific testing framework, you may find more detailed information in its configuration files.

You can use these commands during development to ensure that your application is working as expected and that your code is well-covered by tests.
