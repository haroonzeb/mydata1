####                   Suggestion  from client side 

 (3) the virtual  machine VERTEX AI which type you required 
 or give about  the description of virtual machine to create  
 like google cloud zone , and type of instance .
 so that way i have create the VERTEX AI VM instance.

 (4) As i have create Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS) or 
  google manged key for google cloud storage bucket ?
