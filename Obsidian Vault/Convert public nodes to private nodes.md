To convert public nodes to private nodes with  in a GKE cluster, you can follow these steps using the Google Cloud Console:

1. **Go to the Google Kubernetes Engine page in the Google Cloud Console**.
    
2. **In the list of clusters, click the cluster name** to open the cluster details.
    
3. **On the Clusters page, click the Nodes tab**.
    
4. **Under Node Pools, click the node pool name**.
    
5. **Click Edit**.
    
6. **Select the Enable private nodes checkbox**.
    
7. **Click Save**.

# Limitations
Before you change the cluster isolation mode, consider the following limitations:

You can only change the isolation mode for clusters that use **Private Service Connect**.
Changing the isolation mode is not supported on public clusters running on **legacy networks.**

After you update a public node pool to private mode, workloads that require public internet access might fail in the following scenarios:
(a) Clusters in a Shared VPC network where Private Google Access is not enabled. Manually enable Private Google Access to ensure GKE downloads the assigned node image. For clusters that aren't in a Shared VPC networks, GKE automatically enables Private Google  Access.
(b) Workloads that require access to the internet where Cloud NAT is not enabled or a custom NAT solution is not defined. To allow egress traffic to the internet, enable Cloud NAT or a custom NAT solution.

### Solution Plan for Converting Public Nodes to Private Nodes

#### Prerequisites

- Ensure your GKE cluster uses **Private Service Connect**.

#### Steps to Address Limitations

**1. Enable Private Google Access in Shared VPC Networks**

If your cluster is in a Shared VPC network and Private Google Access is not enabled, you need to manually enable it. This ensures that GKE can download the assigned node images and other necessary resources.

**Steps to Enable Private Google Access:**

a. **Identify the VPC and Subnet:**

- Determine the VPC and subnet where your cluster nodes are located.

b. **Enable Private Google Access:**
used the following command
gcloud compute networks subnets update SUBNET_NAME \
    --region=REGION_NAME \
    --enable-private-ip-google-access

**2. Enable Cloud NAT or Custom NAT Solution**

Workloads that require internet access need a way to route egress traffic. You can enable Cloud NAT or set up a custom NAT solution to allow outbound connectivity.

**Steps to Enable Cloud NAT:**

a. **Create a Cloud Router:**
    gcloud compute routers create NAT_ROUTER_NAME \
    --network=VPC_NAME \
    --region=REGION_NAME
    
b. **Create a Cloud NAT Configuration:**
     gcloud compute routers nats create NAT_CONFIG_NAME \
    --router=NAT_ROUTER_NAME \
    --auto-allocate-nat-external-ips \
    --nat-all-subnet-ip-ranges \
    --region=REGION_NAME

 **3. Update Node Pool to Enable Private Nodes**

After ensuring Private Google Access and Cloud NAT are configured, update your node pool to enable private nodes.
