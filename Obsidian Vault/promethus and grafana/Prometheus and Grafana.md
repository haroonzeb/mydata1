These are the monitored entities (like applications, services, or servers) that produce metrics data.
Retrieval (Data Retrieval Worker):

The Retrieval component is responsible for pulling or scraping the metrics data from the monitored applications, services, or servers. Prometheus uses this to gather data continuously.
This data typically includes information like CPU usage, memory consumption, request counts, etc.
Storage (Time Series Database):

After data is retrieved, it is stored in the Storage component, which acts as a Time Series Database.
Prometheus stores all the metrics data in a time-series format, where each data point is recorded with a timestamp. This allows Prometheus to track changes in metrics over time.
HTTP Server (Accepts PromQL Queries):

The HTTP Server component provides an interface for querying the stored metrics data.
Users can use Prometheus' query language, PromQL, to request and retrieve specific data points or sets of metrics from the database.
Prometheus Web UI and Grafana:

The diagram also indicates that the Prometheus Server can be accessed through the Prometheus Web UI or integrated with Grafana (a popular open-source analytics and monitoring solution).
The Web UI allows users to visualize and explore the metrics data, while Grafana can be used to create more sophisticated dashboards and visualizations.

- **Using an Operator:**
    
    - The image emphasizes the deployment of Prometheus components in Kubernetes using an Operator.
    - A Kubernetes Operator is a method for packaging, deploying, and managing applications or services in Kubernetes. It encapsulates all the operational knowledge needed to manage these components effectively.
- **Manager of All Prometheus Components:**
    
    - The Operator acts as a manager for all the Prometheus components. This means that instead of managing each Prometheus component individually (e.g., Prometheus Server, Alertmanager, etc.), the Operator manages them as a whole.
    - The Operator ensures that all the Prometheus components are deployed, configured, and maintained together as a cohesive unit.
- **Management as One Unit:**
    
    - The Operator handles the combination of all Prometheus components as a single unit. This unified approach simplifies the deployment and management process, ensuring that all components work together seamlessly.
    - The use of an Operator automates tasks such as upgrades, scaling, and recovery, reducing manual intervention and the potential for errors.

### Explanation of Key Elements:

1. **Instance:**
    
    - An "Instance" in Prometheus terminology refers to a specific endpoint that Prometheus is configured to scrape metrics from. This is typically a URL that exposes metrics in a format that Prometheus can understand.
    - In the screenshot, instances are shown as URLs (e.g., `https://192.168.126.249/metrics`), representing different components or services that are being monitored.
2. **Job:**
    
    - A "Job" is a collection of instances that share the same purpose or are related to the same function. For example, all instances that expose metrics for the Kubernetes API server might be grouped under the "apiserver" job.
    - Jobs help organize and manage multiple instances, allowing Prometheus to scrape them based on their common purpose.
3. **Scrape:**
    
    - Scraping is the process by which Prometheus collects metrics data from the instances. The table in the screenshot shows the state of each instance (whether it's "UP" or down) and provides labels that categorize and identify the metrics.
