### Steps to Add Security Headers in Kubernetes
Identify the Ingress Controller:
Most Kubernetes clusters use an Ingress Controller to manage access to the services. Common Ingress Controllers include Nginx, Traefik, and others. This example assumes you are using Nginx as your Ingress Controller.

Configure the Ingress Resource:
You can add custom headers in your Ingress resources. Here’s how you can add the required headers:

Example for Nginx Ingress Controller:
Edit the ConfigMap for Nginx Ingress Controller:

Find and edit the Nginx Ingress Controller’s ConfigMap to include the custom headers.

bash
Copy code
kubectl edit configmap nginx-ingress-controller -n <namespace>
Add the following entries under the data section:

yaml
Copy code
data:
  add-headers: |
    X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: "https://your-allowed-domain.com"
    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Update the Ingress Resource:

Ensure your Ingress resource is configured to use the custom headers. Here’s an example of an Ingress resource definition:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |
      more_set_headers "X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN";
      more_set_headers "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://ondemand.stage.transloc.com/";
      more_set_headers "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff";
spec:
  rules:
  - host: your-service-domain.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: your-service
            port:
              number: 80
Reload Nginx Ingress Controller:

After updating the ConfigMap and Ingress resource, you may need to reload or restart the Nginx Ingress Controller pods to apply the changes. This can be done by deleting the Ingress Controller pods (they will be automatically recreated by the deployment):

bash
Copy code
kubectl delete pods -l app=nginx-ingress-controller -n <namespace>
Example for Traefik Ingress Controller:
If you are using Traefik, you would need to configure middleware for adding headers:

Create Middleware for Headers:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: Middleware
metadata:
  name: security-headers
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  headers:
    frameDeny: true
    contentTypeNosniff: true
    accessControlAllowOrigin: "https://your-allowed-domain.com"
Attach Middleware to IngressRoute:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: example-ingressroute
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  entryPoints:
    - web
  routes:
    - match: Host(`your-service-domain.com`)
      kind: Rule
      services:
        - name: your-service
          port: 80
      middlewares:
        - name: security-headers
Verifying the Configuration
After applying these changes, you should verify that the headers are correctly set by:

Accessing the service using a web browser or a tool like curl.
Inspecting the HTTP response headers to ensure the X-Frame-Options, Access-Control-Allow-Origin, and X-Content-Type-Options headers are present and correctly configured.
bash
Copy code
curl -I https://your-service-domain.com
You should see the headers in the response:

plaintext
Copy code
HTTP/2 200
x-frame-options: SAMEORIGIN
access-control-allow-origin: https://your-allowed-domain.com
x-content-type-options: nosniff
This will confirm that the headers are set and the security issues identified in the scan are addressed.
